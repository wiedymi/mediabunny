Mediabunny is a JavaScript library for reading, writing, and converting media files (like MP4, WebM, MP3), directly in the browser. It aims to be a complete toolkit for high-performance media operations on the web. It's written from scratch in pure TypeScript, has zero dependencies, is very performant, and is extremely tree-shakable, meaning you only include what you use. You can think of it a bit like [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/), but built from the ground up for the web.

## Features

Core features include:

- **Wide format support**: Read and write MP4, MOV, WebM, MKV, AVI, WAVE, MP3, Ogg, ADTS, FLAC
- **Built-in encoding & decoding**: Supports 25+ video, audio, and subtitle codecs, hardware-accelerated using the WebCodecs API
- **High precision**: Fine-grained, microsecond-accurate reading and writing operations
- **Conversion API**: Easy-to-use API with features such as transmuxing, transcoding, resizing, rotation, cropping, resampling, trimming, and more
- **Streaming I/O**: Handle reading & writing files of any size with memory-efficient streaming
- **Tree-shakable**: Only bundle what you use (as small as 5 kB gzipped)
- **Zero dependencies**: Implemented in highly performant TypeScript
- **Cross-platform**: Works in browsers and Node.js

## Quick start

### Installation

Install it via npm:

```bash
npm install mediabunny
```

Alternatively, include it directly with a script tag using one of the [builds](https://github.com/Vanilagy/mediabunny/releases). Doing so exposes a global `Mediabunny` object.
```html
<script src="mediabunny.cjs"></script>
```

Requires any JavaScript environment that can run ECMAScript 2021 or later. Mediabunny is expected to be run in modern browsers. For types, TypeScript 5.7 or later is required.

### Read file metadata

```js
import { Input, ALL_FORMATS, BlobSource } from 'mediabunny';

const input = new Input({
    source: new BlobSource(file), // Reading from disk
    formats: ALL_FORMATS,
});

const duration = await input.computeDuration(); // in seconds
const videoTrack = await input.getPrimaryVideoTrack();
const audioTrack = await input.getPrimaryAudioTrack();
const { displayWidth, displayHeight, rotation } = videoTrack;
const { sampleRate, numberOfChannels } = audioTrack;
const { title, artist, album } = await input.getMetadataTags();
```

### Create new media files

```js
import { Output, Mp4OutputFormat, BufferTarget, CanvasSource, QUALITY_HIGH } from 'mediabunny';

const output = new Output({
    format: new Mp4OutputFormat(),
    target: new BufferTarget(), // Writing to memory
});

// Add a video track backed by a canvas element
const videoSource = new CanvasSource(canvas, {
    codec: 'avc',
    bitrate: QUALITY_HIGH,
});
output.addVideoTrack(videoSource);

await output.start();
// Add frames...
await output.finalize();

const buffer = output.target.buffer; // Final MP4 file
```

### Convert files

```js
import { Input, Output, Conversion, ALL_FORMATS, BlobSource, WebMOutputFormat } from 'mediabunny';

const input = new Input({
    source: new BlobSource(file),
    formats: ALL_FORMATS,
});

const output = new Output({
    format: new WebMOutputFormat(), // Convert to WebM
    target: new BufferTarget(),
});

const conversion = await Conversion.init({ input, output });
await conversion.execute();
```

## Implementation & development

Mediabunny is implemented from scratch in pure TypeScript with zero dependencies. At its core, the library is a collection of multiplexers and demultiplexers (one for every container format), which are then connected together via abstractions around the WebCodecs API. The logic is heavily pipelined and lazy, keeping performance high and memory usage low. If this stuff interests you, refer to the [Technical overview](https://mediabunny.dev/guide/introduction#technical-overview) for more.

For development, clone this repository and install it using a modern version of Node.js and npm. The build system uses TypeScript, esbuild, API Extractor, Vite, and VitePress.

```bash
npm install # Install dependencies
npm run watch # Build bundles on watch mode

npm run build # Production build with type definitions

npm run check # Type checking
npm run lint # ESLint

npm run docs:generate # Generates API docs
npm run docs:dev # Start docs development server
npm run dev # Start examples development server

npm run docs:build # Build docs and examples
